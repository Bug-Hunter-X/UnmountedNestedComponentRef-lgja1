This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a nested component that is unmounted prematurely.  The issue arises because the ref still holds a reference to the unmounted component, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior when trying to access its properties or methods.

```javascript
// Buggy Component
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  const handlePress = () => {
    if (myRef.current) {
      // This line will cause an error if the nested component is unmounted
      myRef.current.someMethod(); 
    }
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <NestedComponent ref={myRef} />
      <Button title="Press Me" onPress={handlePress} />
    </View>
  );
}

function NestedComponent(props) {
  // ...Nested component implementation...
  return <Text>Hello from Nested Component</Text>;
}
```
