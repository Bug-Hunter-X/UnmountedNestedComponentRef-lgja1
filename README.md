# React Native useRef Hook Error with Unmounted Nested Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications involving the `useRef` hook and prematurely unmounted nested components.  The bug occurs when a reference to a component is held via `useRef`, and the referenced component is unmounted before the reference is cleared.  Attempting to access properties or methods of the unmounted component will result in unexpected behavior or crashes.

## Bug Description
The bug lies in attempting to access a `useRef`'s current value after its associated component is unmounted.  This typically happens when a parent component holds a reference to a child component that's removed from the render tree, leading to issues when trying to use the ref later.

## Solution
The solution involves checking whether the referenced component is still mounted before accessing it.  A simple null check is often sufficient.  Improved solutions may involve using the `useEffect` hook with cleanup to ensure resources and references are properly managed when components are unmounted.
