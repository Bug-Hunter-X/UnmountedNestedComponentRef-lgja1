To fix this, check if the component still exists before trying to use the ref:

```javascript
// Corrected Component
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  const handlePress = () => {
    if (myRef.current) {
      //Check if the component is mounted before accessing
      if(myRef.current && myRef.current.someMethod){
        myRef.current.someMethod();
      } else {
        console.log("Component is unmounted");
      }
    }
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <NestedComponent ref={myRef} />
      <Button title="Press Me" onPress={handlePress} />
    </View>
  );
}

function NestedComponent(props) {
  // ...Nested component implementation...
  return <Text>Hello from Nested Component</Text>;
}
```

This ensures that you don't try to access a component that is no longer in the DOM.  More robust solutions could involve using a state variable to track the component's mounted state or adopting a different architectural approach that avoids this pattern.  The key is to prevent access to the component after unmounting.
